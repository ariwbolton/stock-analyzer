# stock-analyzer

Stock analyzation environment written in C++

Includes bash scripts that pull daily data from Google Finance,
a C++ program which can utilize this data using any stock
analyzation program (although it currently only implements
a simple Bollinger Band indicator algorithm), and more bash scripts
along with C++ files to pull and parse additional indicator data from
Barchart.com.
